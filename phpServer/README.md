A basic PHP server which can be run locally. No external modules used.

### How to run locally

Make sure you have `php` installed on your machine. Clone the main repo and navigate to this directory. Run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080` to run the server locally at port 8080. Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` in the address bar.
